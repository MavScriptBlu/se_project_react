## Setup & Deployment Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup (Important!)

Before running the frontend, you must start the backend server:

1. Install JSON Server globally (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server@0.17.4
   ```

   Note: This project requires JSON Server version 0.17.0 to ensure compatibility with the reviewer's environment.

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --id _id --port 3001
   ```
3. The backend will be running at `http://localhost:3001`
   - Note: The delete functionality will only work when the backend server is running!

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Important Notes

- The delete functionality requires the backend server to be running
- If items are not deleting, please ensure the backend server (json-server) is running on port 3001
- Both servers (frontend and backend) need to be running simultaneously for full functionality
